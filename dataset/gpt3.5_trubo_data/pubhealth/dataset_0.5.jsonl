He delves into the history and context of the law, which was passed in 1982, requiring heads of households to own at least one firearm. Kopel examines various statistics and studies to evaluate the impact of this law on crime rates in Kennesaw. While he acknowledges that crime rates did decrease after the law was enacted, he argues that it is challenging to establish a direct causal relationship between mandatory gun ownership and the decline in crime. Kopel highlights other factors that could have contributed to the decrease, such as overall national crime trends and increased community involvement in crime prevention.

The study, conducted on laboratory rats, revealed that excessive alcohol consumption led to an increase in certain brain chemicals associated with appetite regulation.
