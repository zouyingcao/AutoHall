The leaked emails suggested that the DNC showed favoritism towards Hillary Clinton during the 2016 Democratic primary, which led to a loss of trust among Bernie Sanders' supporters and increased tensions within the party. As a result, Debbie Wasserman Schultz announced her resignation as the DNC Chairwoman on July 24, 2016, just before the party's national convention. The article also mentions that other high-ranking officials, including Luis Miranda, Brad Marshall, and Amy Dacey, also stepped down from their positions due to the fallout from the WikiLeaks releases."}], "stream": false, "temperature": 0.5, "label": "chat.completion", "created": 1692285792, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "True.
