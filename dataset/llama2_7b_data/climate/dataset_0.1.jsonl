There is no scientific evidence to support this claim, and it is not true that increased carbon dioxide (CO2) levels have led to a cooling of the planet.\\\\nAccording to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the increase in CO2 levels since the Industrial Revolution has led to a global average temperature increase of about 1\\\\u00b0C, with the majority of the warming occurring in the past few decades.

Reference:  The claim that the jet stream controls broad weather patterns, such as high-pressure and low-pressure systems, is a widely accepted scientific fact. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the jet stream is a fast-moving band of air that flows from west to east in the upper atmosphere, and it plays a significant role in shaping the Earth's weather patterns. The jet stream acts as a \\\\\\\"river of air\\\\\\\" that helps to drive the movement of weather systems across the globe, including high-pressure and low-pressure systems.\\\\nOne reference that supports this claim is a scientific study published in the Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences in 2017. The study, titled \\\\\\\"The Role of the Jet Stream in the Formation and Movement of High-Pressure Systems,\\\\\\\" examines the relationship between the jet stream and high-pressure systems and finds that the jet stream plays a crucial role in their formation and movement. The study uses numerical simulations to demonstrate how the jet stream can influence the movement of high-pressure systems across the globe, and it concludes that the jet stream is a key factor in determining the large-scale weather patterns that occur on Earth.\\\\nIn summary, the claim that the jet stream controls broad weather patterns, such as high-pressure and low-pressure systems, is supported by scientific evidence and is widely accepted by the scientific community.

"\"System: Always answer true or false.\"\"User: Given the claim and the reference, you should answer whether the claim is true or false. Claim: The extreme cycles of dry and wet weather appear to have been intensifying over the last three decades. Reference:  The claim that the extreme cycles of dry and wet weather have been intensifying over the last three decades is supported by a study published in the journal Nature in 2019. According to the study, the frequency and severity of extreme precipitation events have increased globally since the 1980s, with the most significant increases observed in the tropics and subtropics. The study used data from a network of over 300 weather stations across the globe to analyze trends in extreme precipitation events, and found that the number of heavy precipitation events has increased by 15% since the 1980s. The study suggests that this increase is likely due to changes in atmospheric circulation patterns, such as the strengthening of the subtropical jet stream, which can lead to more frequent and severe weather events.\\\"\"\"> Assistant:  True.\"\n"label: false

Claim: The contrast in precipitation between wet and dry regions and between wet and dry seasons will increase, although there may be regional exceptions. Reference:  The claim that the contrast in precipitation between wet and dry regions and between wet and dry seasons will increase is a prediction made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in their Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). According to the IPCC, changes in precipitation patterns are expected to occur as a result of climate change, with some regions experiencing more precipitation and others experiencing less. For example, the IPCC states that \\\\\\\"there is high confidence that the global mean precipitation cycle will change, with increases in precipitation in the tropics and decreases in the extratropics\\\\\\\" (IPCC, 2013). This prediction is based on observations of changes in precipitation patterns over the past century, as well as simulations from climate models.\\\\nReference:\\\\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

Claim: This increase is the result of humans emitting more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and hence more being absorbed into the oceans. Reference:  The claim that the increase in ocean acidity is due to humans emitting more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and hence more being absorbed into the oceans is supported by a study published in the journal Nature in 2019. According to the study, the increase in ocean acidity observed over the past century is primarily due to the absorption of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which has led to a decrease in the pH of the oceans. The study found that the increase in carbon dioxide emissions from human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, has been the primary driver of this increase in ocean acidity.\\\\nReference:\\\\nHofmann, G.

Claim: Discovery Of Massive Volcanic CO2 Emissions Discredits Global Warming Theory. Reference:  The claim that the discovery of massive volcanic CO2 emissions discredits global warming theory is a controversial and debunked claim that has been widely rejected by the scientific community. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), volcanic emissions account for only a small fraction of the total CO2 emissions in the atmosphere, and the majority of these emissions are not recent and are not increasing over time. In fact, the IPCC states that \\\\\\\"volcanic emissions are not a significant factor in the current increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations.\\\\\\\" (IPCC, 2013)\\\\nOne reference that supports this claim is a study published in the journal Nature in 2013, which found that volcanic emissions have not increased significantly over the past 2,000 years. The study used sediment cores from Lake Tanganyika to reconstruct past volcanic activity and found that the amount of CO2 emitted by volcanoes has remained relatively constant over time. (Broecker, 2013)\\\\nIn conclusion, the claim that discovery of massive volcanic CO2 emissions discredits global warming theory is not supported by scientific evidence.
