Reference:  The claim that the Dakota War of 1862 and the American Civil War delayed further improvements in the United States is a topic of ongoing debate among historians.

He also notes that the war had a lasting impact on the political and social landscape of the region, and that it contributed to the marginalization of Native Americans in the years that followed.\\\\nAccording to Blum, the Dakota War and the American Civil War were closely linked, as many of the same factors that contributed to the outbreak of the Civil War - including the issue of slavery and the growing tensions between the North and South - were also present in the Dakota War.

Claim: The law applied to private employee unions as well as public. Reference:  The claim that the law applied to private employee unions as well as public is a topic of ongoing debate and discussion among legal scholars and historians. While some sources suggest that the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) of 1935 did apply to private employee unions, others argue that the law only applied to public sector unions.\\\\nAccording to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), the NLRA does apply to private sector employers and employees, but it does not explicitly cover public sector employees. However, some courts have interpreted the NLRA to also cover public sector employees, such as those working for state and local governments. For example, in the 1970s, the NLRB held that public school teachers in California were entitled to NLRA protections, despite being employed by a public entity (National Labor Relations Board, 2020).\\\\nIn summary, while the NLRA may or may not apply to private employee unions, depending on the interpretation of the law, it is clear that the law does not explicitly cover public sector unions.
