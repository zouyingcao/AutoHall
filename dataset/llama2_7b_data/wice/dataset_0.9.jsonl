Claim: Also, resource mobilization applies because of the fact that the people who founded the organization knew how to utilize the resources available, which implies that anyone who uses the website to sign a petition or start a petition are rational social actors who act as utility maximizers, who weigh the costs and benefits before deciding to be a part of a social movement. Reference:  The claim that resource mobilization theory applies to social movements because the founders of the organization knew how to utilize available resources is a commonly discussed idea in the field of social movement theory. According to the reference provided, \\\\\\\"Resource mobilization theory (RMT) is a framework for understanding the role of resources in social movement outcomes. RMT posits that successful social movements are those that are able to mobilize and utilize resources, including money, people, and media attention, to achieve their goals\\\\\\\" (McCarthy & Zald, 1977).\\\\nIn summary, resource mobilization theory suggests that the success of a social movement is directly related to the ability of the movement to mobilize and utilize resources. This means that the founders of a social movement who are able to effectively mobilize resources are more likely to be successful in their efforts, whereas those who are unable to do so may struggle to make progress. This idea is supported by numerous studies in the field of social movement theory, and it is an important consideration for anyone interested in understanding the dynamics of social movements.\\\"\"\"> Assistant:  True.\"\n"label: true
