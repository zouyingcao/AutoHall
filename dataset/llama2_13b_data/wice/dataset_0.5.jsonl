Summarize the reference: The article examines the coalition formation process in Turkey after the 2015 general elections, with a focus on the role of political polarization. The authors argue that the political landscape in Turkey has become increasingly polarized, making it challenging for parties to form a coalition government.

Summarize the reference in a paragraph:\\\\n\\\\nThe Wars of the Roses were a series of conflicts fought between the houses of Lancaster and York in medieval England, specifically from 1455 to 1485. This dynastic struggle was sparked by the death of King Henry V, which led to a dispute over his throne between his infant son, Henry VI, and Richard, Duke of York, who claimed that he had a better right to the crown due to his descent from Edward III through his son Lionel. The Beauforts, led by Cardinal Beaufort and later by Queen Margaret, supported Henry VI and the House of Lancaster, while the Yorkists, led by Richard, Duke of York and later by Edward IV, opposed them. The conflict escalated into full-scale civil war, resulting in many battles and atrocities, including the infamous Battle of Blore Heath.

According to Gallup polls, Nixon's approval rating averaged around 13% in the months leading up to his resignation in August 1974. This low approval rating was largely due to the Watergate scandal, which had eroded public trust in the presidency and led to widespread criticism of Nixon's leadership. For example, a Gallup poll conducted in July 1974 found that only 13% of Americans approved of Nixon's job performance, while a whopping 75% disapproved. This poll was conducted shortly before Nixon's resignation, and it reflects the intense public scrutiny and criticism that he faced during his final months in office.\\\"\\n Response:  True.  Based on the reference provided, there are several sources that support the claim that Richard Nixon was one of the most unpopular politicians in the history of the United States. Specifically, according to Gallup polls, Nixon's approval rating averaged around 13% in the months leading up to his resignation in August 1974. This low approval rating was largely due to the Watergate scandal, which had eroded public trust in the presidency and led to widespread criticism of Nixon's leadership.
